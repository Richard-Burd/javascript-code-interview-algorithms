This is a place to learn about some of the algorithms that software company hiring bureaucracies will throw at junior developers.  The objective is to explore new ways to illustrate these algorithms so as to make them more accessible to visual learners.

## The Zig-Zag-O-Gram
The **ZigZagOGram** method of illustrating programming functions was developed by yours truly to show how functions work line-by-line in a two-dimensional graphic environment.  The basic idea is to *zig-zag* the dimension of time across the drawing so as to trace each step in the code as each line of code fires off.&nbsp; To do this, let's take a look at the function in this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL1HB_IC9Fc&list=PLD_PIFu4jYOuMnFRKQbl21_jZvtxsIFuz&index=6) and draw it out:

The code is available [here](https://github.com/Richard-Burd/javascript-code-interview-algorithms/blob/master/chunkedArray.js) in this repo.

Eventually I want to figure out a way to reverse-engineer this orientation and essentially be able to "draw out" an algorithm like this one by first filling in the information in the iteration blocks, and then afterwards, create the actual function to make it all work.&nbsp; This puts the work of creating such an algorithm in the two-dimensional graphical space and allows a brain with good visual-spatial reasoning to tackle the problem.&nbsp;  Currently, only those brains with strong  neural pathways supporting quantitative reasoning can do this sort-of thing, and that limits many of us for whom quantitative reasoning is exceedingly difficult.
